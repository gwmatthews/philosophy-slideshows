Why did people find Socrates' questions so threatening that they killed an old man who would likely soon pass away anyway?

### *philo-sophia*

---

--

The word "philosophy" comes from the Greek words for "love of wisdom."

--
 
- Philosophy seeks understanding of the nature of reality and the significance of our lives by applying critical reasoning to our deepest and most general beliefs.

--

- It draws out basic assumptions, by asking questions with all of the wonder of children.

--

- And it subjects them to careful analysis with all of the precision of a lawyer.

---

.caution[

.red[Science] also seeks to understand reality, but it differs from philosophy in its method of evaluating its claims.

]

--

- If you are wrong in science your predictions fail, or you blow up the lab.

--

- If you are wrong in philosophy, your principles and most general beliefs conflict with each other and your mind is at odds with itself.

--

- Failure to clarify one's life philosophically may seem unimportant, yet for Socrates such an un-examined life misses what is most valuable about being human.


---

.caution[

.red[Religion] addresses the significance of our lives, but it differs from philosophy in how it proceeds.

]

--

- Religion emerges from the spontaneous ways we make meaning in our lives. It often embraces mythical and magical thinking which places us at the center of life's drama.

--

- Philosophy seeks clarification and justification and asks how we might find meaning in a world even where it might not be all about us.

- This is not a question about how we do in fact live but of how we *should* live.

]

--

.right-list[

- Such *normative* questions challenge us to give an account of ourselves, our values and our assumptions.

]

--

.right-list[

- Socrates' question is a question in the sub-field of philosophy called .red[value theory] or .red[axiology].

- Is morality in the eye of the beholder or are some things *really* right or wrong?

- Can the ends ever justify the means, or should some things just never be done?

- What would a just society look like and how might we get there from here?

--

.right-list[

- Descartes asked this question at the beginning of the Scientific Revolution when old certainties were revealed to be based on false assumptions.

]

--

.right-list[

- Answering it requires clarifying the nature of knowledge and its varieties.

- Philosophical questions are often much more general than questions we normally encounter.

--

.right-list[

- Science seeks answers to particular questions about the regularities in the world of our experience and shrinks away from such general questions as being unanswerable.

--

.right-list[

- This is a question in the sub-field of philosophy called .red[metaphysics] or .red[ontology] which seeks an account of the basic nature of reality.

- What sorts of things exist -- only matter, or minds/souls/disembodied spirits as well?

--

- What *is* the relationship between minds and brains, and can we build an artificial brain that actually has a mind?

--

- How is freedom even possible in a world where everything that happens seems to have a cause outside of itself?

--

- Does God exist?  This question is related to epistemological questions about religion (How can we know for sure?), and value theiry questions (What does it matter?) as well.

## *The philosopher's toolkit*

---

--

.caution[
Since philosophy potentially asks us to examine *all* of our assumptions, there can be no fixed method for doing philosophy - historically speaking there have been many.
]

--

Over time, however, certain useful principles have been developed.

--

- Explicitly state our assumptions -- this can be a challenge since they *are* assumptions.

--

- Draw out their logical implications -- do theses fit well with each other or do they clash with other ideas we have?

--

- Make lots of distinctions. (Also the reason for the bad reputation of philosophers! Splitting hairs, or distinguishing real differences? It can be hard to tell.)

### *Socrates and Thrasymachus debate justice*

<br><br>
---

--

- As an example of how philosophical analysis proceeds, consider the following dialogue between Socrates and Thrasymachus, a contemporary of Socrates who held that philosophical questioning was irrelevant.

--

- For Thrasymachus, might makes right in the sense that the powerful get to define what key ideas like "justice" really mean.

--

- Socrates, on the other hand highlights how true wisdom alone can guide us and so we must let logic lead the way.
