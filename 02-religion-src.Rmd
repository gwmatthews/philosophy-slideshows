## *Does God exist?*

.left-column[

#### .red[YES]

#### NO

#### MAYBE

]

---

.right-column[

**Theism** is the general term for the belief in the existence of a God or gods.

]

--

.right-list[

- Monotheism: there is only one God, and that God is a being with "personhood," with thoughts, feelings, intentions, free will...

]

--

.right-list[

- Polytheism: there are multiple gods often with many different personalities.

]

--

.right-list[

- Pantheism: God is everywhere or in every thing.

]

---

.right-column[

.caution[

Note that actual religions don't always clearly fit these definitions.

]

]

--

.right-list[

- Hinduism is polytheistic, but Krishna is often seen as the main "God" with many other divinities as Krishna's "avatars" or manifestations.

]

--

.right-list[

- Christianity claims that God is *both* unitary *and* has three separate "persons" -- Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

## *Does God exist?*

.left-column[

#### YES

#### .red[NO]

#### MAYBE

]

--

.right-column[

**Atheism** refers to the denial of the existence of God, the gods or a supernatural realm of spirits.

]

--

.right-list[

.caution[

It is sometimes,asserted that it it impossible to "prove a negative," or demonstrate that something does **not** exist or is **not true**. 

But we do this all the time, whenever we show that the existence of something entails a contradiction, or is logically incompatible with other things we know to be true.

#### NO

#### .red[MAYBE]

]

--

.right-column[

**Agnosticism** Is the view that we cannot tell for sure whether or not a God exists.

]

--

.right-list[

.caution[

This is more an *epistemological* than a *metaphysical* view -- it concerns what we can *know* and not what exists.

]

]

--

.right-list[

- Buddhism might be considered an agnostic religion since it has many features of religion, yet often denies that metaphysical claims about the ultimate nature of reality matter.

]

--

.middletext[

<br>

.left-blurb[

"God is evident in basic facts about the world of our experience."

]
]

--

.right-list[

- Aquinas was an important figure in the history of the Catholic Church.

]

--

.right-list[

- He combined the conceptual framework of Ancient Greek philosophy with Christianity, thus given definitive form to the medieval world-view of the Great Chain of Being, where everything in Nature has its place in a world ruled by God.

The Cosmological Argument

]

.right-argument[

Everything that exists has a cause.

The universe as a whole exists.

***

So the universe as a whole has a cause -- God.

]

--

.right-column[

- The key idea here is that *this* universe exists and that specific things need specific causes. But *must* this cause be the God of Christianity?

"Reason alone can show us that God *must* exist."

]
]

.right-list[

- Anselm was an early Medieval philosopher convinced of the power of human reason to make sense of things.

]

--

.right-list[

- His most famous argument is a negative argument that shows that God cannot, *not* exist.

The Ontological Argument

]

--

.right-argument[

We can imagine the existence of a perfect being.

But if such a being *did not exist* it would lack something and so be less than perfect.

***

Thus a perfect being must exist -- God.

]

--

.wide-list[

- Something seems fishy here, but it is hard to see what. 

]

--

.wide-list[

- Can such abstract reasoning do more than just restate our original assumption that we *can* imagine such a being?

]

--

.middletext[

<br>

.left-blurb[

"The hand of God is visible in the complexity of the natural world."

]
]

.right-list[

- William Paley was an Anglican minister whose "natural theology" was taken to be the best explanation for biological complexity until Darwin challenged it.

]

.right-list[

- His argument is still popular among Christian fundamentalists who use it to oppose evolution.

Paley's Watch

]

.right-argument[

If you found a watch on the beach you'd be right to think it was not a product of chance but of design.

The organisms we "find" in nature are even more complex than a watch.

***

Thus a designer powerful enough to have designed biological organisms must exist -- God.

]

--

.wide-list[

- This argument fails to mention other possible explanations for biological complexity, like the "blind watchmaker" of evolution by natural selection. 

]

---
## *Faith and the limits of reason*

.top-right[

![:scale 60%, #ccc;](img/02/church-3-valter-cirillio.jpg)

]

--
.left-list[

- None of these arguments seem so convincing to modern readers.

]

--

- Perhaps the Eighteenth Century philosopher Immanuel Kant was right that these kinds of big metaphysical questions cannot be answered in any definite way.

--

- What then about appealing to faith as the basis of religious belief?

--
<br>

.caution[

Appeals to faith are a double-edged sword. If there are .red[no reasons] offered, only belief, we also have no reason to take such appeals seriously.
