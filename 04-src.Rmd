## *The Mind/Body Problem*

.question[

  What is the place of the mind and mental phenomena in the physical universe?

]

![:vspace 10px]()

- The mind/body problem is a metaphysical issue since it concerns the basic sorts of things that exist.

- In this slideshow we will examine some of the major ways of addressing this problem that have been addressed since the scientific revolution challenged the ancient belief in the existence of the soul.

- We'll do this by looking at major theoretical approaches and what might be said both in favor of and against them.

![:vspace 10px]()

- .red[Dualism]: minds and bodies are two entriely separate things, so minds are NOT a part of the physical universe at all.

- .red[Behaviorism]: minds are nothing but certain patterns of behavior which we refer to as intelligent.

- .red[Mind/Brain Identity Theory]: minds are collections of states of the physical brain.

- .red[Functionalism]: minds are the software or sets of functions, carried out by the components of physical brains.
